Getting Started - 
1.	Clone the repository into your local using git clone and make sure all the dependencies are downloaded and updated.
2.	The system should have java 8 or above along with git, maven installed.
3.	Install the cucumber and testNG plugins into your IDEs.
4.	Once the repository is downloaded, make sure the project is converted to a Maven Cucumber project.

Features â€“ 
1.	BDD Cucumber Framework.
2.	Page Object Model (POM).
3.	Selenium Java (Selenium 4)
4.	Test NG Framework.
5.	Maven Build Automation Tool.

Points to be followed - 
1.	Have used BDD Cucumber framework + Page Object Model + Selenium Java + Test NG (Hybrid Framework) along with Maven Build Automation Tool.

2.	As it's a cucumber project , I have kept all the feature files (with test steps) in src/test/resources source folder. And all the step definitions , Hooks and Runner classes in src/test/java source folder.

3.	Utility classes like webdriver factory , config reader and Page classes are in src/main/java source folder.

4.	Here I have used cucumber + testng to run my test feature files. So the runner class is located at src/test/java/com.runners/TestNGRunner.java.

5.	For reporting I have used both Extent reports HTML and PDF format. After execution the detailed reports will be available at test-output -> pdfReport/SparkReport folders.

6.	To execute the test cases , we can directly execute the runner file i.e. TestNGRunner.java with TestNG Test.

7.	To execute the test cases using Maven Build, we have to run the command "clean verify" using Maven command line or directly in eclipse using Maven Build Configuration.

8.	After the execution the report can be viewed using Spark.html or ExtentPdf.pdf.
